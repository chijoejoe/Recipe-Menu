## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I was able to create a good recipe menu page thats responsive and was able to style a table in a way i haven't done before.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.tr:last-child {
  border-bottom: none;
}
```

### Continued development

Whilst the project was fairly easy, i need to put more effort towards the reponsiveness of websites

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_styling.asp) - This helped me to design the table section
